                <h2 tabindex="0">History of Malaysia</h2>
                <p tabindex="0">Malaysia’s history is a fascinating blend of ancient traditions, colonial influences, and modern development. Its story begins with 
                    the early Malay kingdoms, such as the Srivijaya and Majapahit empires, which were thriving centers of trade and culture.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">From the 16th century, Malaysia came under the influence of various colonial powers. The Portuguese captured Melaka in 1511, followed by the
                    Dutch and later the British, who established control over much of the peninsula. These interactions left a lasting legacy, seen in Malaysia’s architecture, language, and governance systems.</p>
                <p tabindex="0">In 1957, Malaysia gained independence from British rule, marking a new chapter of unity and progress. In 1963, the Federation of Malaysia was formed,
                    including Sabah, Sarawak, and Singapore, although Singapore became an independent nation in 1965.</p>

                <h2 tabindex="0">Culture of Malaysia</h2>
                <p tabindex="0">Malaysia is a fascinating country with a vibrant multicultural population. Besides the Malays and the native groups,
                    immigrants from China, India, Indonesia and other parts of the world have all contributed to the multi-racial composition of its population. </p>
                <p tabindex="0"     >Other than food, this blend is celebrated in its festivals, arts, and daily lives, creating a vibrant cultural landscape.</p>
